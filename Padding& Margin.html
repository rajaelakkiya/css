        <i> sometimes shortened to simply mobile, cell, or just phone, is a portable telephone 
         that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a 
         telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems
          of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). 
          Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture and, therefore,
           mobile telephones are called cellular telephones or cell phones in North America. In addition to
            telephony, digital mobile phones (2G) support a variety of other services, such as
             text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications
              (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, video games and digital photography. Mobile phones offering only those capabilities are known as feature phones; 
        mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones.</i>
